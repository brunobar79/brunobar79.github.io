	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

			<p>
				I'm Bruno Barbieri, a {{ age }} years old dude from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay">Uruguay</a> currently living in Brooklyn, NY. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I've tried a bunch of things in my life like being a rockstar, skateboarder, a beast tamer but I wasn't good enough so I decided to fully dedicate to the only thing I've being doing consistently during the last {{ experience }} years of my life: <strong>Coding</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been playing many roles in the tech area like: sysadmin, full-stack developer, SEO &amp; Analytics consultant, CTO but I realized that what I enjoy the most is to create user facing stuff: A.K.A <strong>"Frontend"</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				That's exactly what I'm doing right now as a Senior Software Engineer at <a hre="https://delivery.com">delivery.com</a> mastering my skills on AngularJS, Compass, Grunt among other cool things</a>	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I've been talking in a couple of conferences (<a href="https://eventioz.com.ar/e/devfest-uruguay/speakers">Google DevFest 2012</a> and <a href="https://eventioz.com.ar/e/devfest-montevideo-2013/speakers">Google Developer Day 2013</a> in Montevideo) and doing good in hackathons (<a href="https://plus.google.com/110838246905006662525/posts/MdaVyP42fUx">1st place</a> on Startup Weekend MVD and <a href="http://hackday.co/post/23103616177/and-the-finalists-are">2nd place</a> on Hackday Buenos Aires)
			<p>

			<p>Lately I've fall in love with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> and WatchOS, so I'm kinda an iOS guy too..</p>

			<p>
				I've been working on a few personal projects and some of then are Open Source.
